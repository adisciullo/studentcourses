	 When Spring Data JPA creates the Spring bean instance for the CourseRepository interface
	 it inspects all query methods defined in it and derives a query for each of them.
	 By default Spring Data JPA will automatically parse the method name and creates a query from it.
	 The query is implemented using the JPA criteria API. In this case the findByName(â€¦)
	 method is logically equivalent to the JPQL query: "select c from Course c where c.name = ?1".
	 The parser that analyzes the method name supports quite a large set of
	 keywords such as And, Or, GreaterThan, LessThan, Like, IsNull, Not and so on.
